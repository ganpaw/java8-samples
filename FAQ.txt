Q1. What type of lambda expression?
A functional interface (An interface with only ONE abstract method). 

Examples: Runnable, Comparator, FileFilter are the functional interfaces

Q2 Can a lambda be put in a variable?
Yes, we can. This way, we can pass it as method parameter, return from a method.

Q3. Is a lambda expression an object?
It is a not an object but is type of an java 8 object which has its own identity. Lambda should not be used as
a regular object. Should be seen as a piece of code which can be moved around and execute. where as anonymous class impl.
uses 'new' and creating a new object. So JVM really rocks in case of Lambda expressions.
